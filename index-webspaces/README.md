# Index-webspaces

This program is given a target-dir and then makes a list of all the subdirs that match a given criteria (Currently hardcoded).  That list is then placed into an html-format and printed out.

* This doesn't currently work as a standalone script.
  It does, however, work from the REPL
* I should learn how to use OSICAT better, but need to find out how to make their directory iterator short-circuit first.  I don't want it to unnecessarily walk through every file in the subdirectories.
