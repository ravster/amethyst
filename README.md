# Amethyst

This is a project to provide objective evaluation of trading systems out there that are based on technical analysis.  As I see it right now, this will involve a basic system of trade-system simulations.  Raw data is usually easily found, and after that its just a matter of coding the indicators and then processing them.  

Most of this work has already been done, and this project is the opportunity to work on the trading systems themselves and not worry about the 'plumbing'.  I'm thinking that with experience, I'll be able to code up better plumbing in this domain which will allow people to code simulations of their own more easily.  This is expected to happen after I produce the same code 10 times and then finally just abstract it away.

## The programs/simulations

They will be found by searching for them on the internet.  A lot of them will also come from ideas that I get from reading books on the subject.

Each program resides in its own directory.  They all have their own README files that will explain (Or at least describe) how to use the program, along with other relevant README-file information.  The first one is named after the first consistently profitable trading system that I found, but I'm thinking that I'll be using a date-based naming system for most of them.

All the programs are ASDF systems in their own right, and are independent of each other, with their own packages.  They are all under the amethyst project since I don't want to make a gajillion repositories.  If you are interested in only particular systems, just download their directories individually.

## Misc

Amethyst is the name of one of the binary stars that the planet "Pleasance" orbits.  This is in the Known Space Universe by Larry Niven.  Man-Kzin Wars 11, "Teacher's Pet" by Matthew Joseph Harrington.  There is a research base orbiting the star and my amethyst project could count as research.
