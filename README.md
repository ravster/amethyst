# Amethyst

This is a collection of random projects that I have done.

All the programs are ASDF systems in their own right, and are independent of each other, with their own packages.  They are all under the amethyst project since I don't want to make a gajillion repositories.  If you are interested in only particular systems, just download their directories individually.

If you want the history of a particular program, then download the whole repository and then do a `git filter-branch` on it.

## The programs

* Random-entry

Program that checks the profitability of a trading system that decides on buy-or-sell orders randomly

* Index-webspaces

Program that creates an html-file with links to directories that match a certain criteria.

## Misc

Amethyst is the name of one of the binary stars that the planet "Pleasance" orbits.  This is in the Known Space Universe by Larry Niven.  Man-Kzin Wars 11, "Teacher's Pet" by Matthew Joseph Harrington.  There is a research base orbiting the star and my amethyst project could count as research.
