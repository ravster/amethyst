# Amethyst

This is a collection of random projects of mine.  Some of them may grow and spin off into their own repositories.  Most of them will wither on the vine and die off.  This has happened with all the code I did for:

- common lisp
- android
- clojure
- java

I'm currently on the C train, and so there will be more of that in here.  It helps a great deal that C lends itself so well to 1-2 program files and that's it.  A lot of the systems out there now (java, clojure, nodejs, android, rails) lend themselves to over-architected file hierarchies.  Most programs don't need any of that.

Less is more.

## Misc

Amethyst is the name of one of the binary stars that the planet "Pleasance" orbits.  This is in the Known Space Universe by Larry Niven.  Man-Kzin Wars 11, "Teacher's Pet" by Matthew Joseph Harrington.  There is a research base orbiting the star and my amethyst project could count as research.  Peace Corben, the protagonist, goes there as a tourist having fun in the name of "work".  This codebase is for my fun.  Productive and educational fun; what a great idea.
